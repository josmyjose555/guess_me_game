# Guess Me Game!
## Hello Friends,
 This is a simple guess_me game written in python language.
 The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) 
 If the userâ€™s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear .
 
 ***Instructions***

4. after 10 guess user can go for 2nd hint like sum of digit/number range like that 
5. if the input and random number is same 
6. result should be displayed in "Alphabetic manner "
